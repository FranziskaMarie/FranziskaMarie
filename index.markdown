title: Vehicle thefts in San Francisco
---

<p>
Over the past few years, San Francisco has experienced a significant number of criminal incidents. The authorities have made an effort to collect data on all recorded crimes that took place in the city in the period 2003 to 2017 and made it public. An initial inspection of the collected dataset, indicates that there has been a considerable fluctuation in the number of incidents in many out of the 37 diferrent crime categories, during the years. In particular, Vehicle Theft in San Francisco has experienced dramatic changes in its occurences in the examined years. Thus, our investigation will solely focus on examining and analyzing how and why these changes have occured.

In the early 2000s, San Francisco was plagued by a surge in vehicle thefts. Cars parked on the streets were being stolen at an alarming rate, and the city's police department struggled to keep up with the crime wave. However, things began to change in 2006, when car manufacturers started installing immobilizer systems in new vehicles. The analytical decrease of vehicle theft can be thorougly inspected in figure 1.

The immobilizer system is a security feature that prevents a car from starting without the proper key. It uses a microchip embedded in the key that communicates with the car's onboard computer, allowing the engine to start only if the key is present. This made it much harder for thieves to steal cars, as they could no longer simply hotwire the ignition.

The impact of the immobilizer system soon became evident in the area. According to police data, vehicle thefts in the city dropped by more than 60% in the years following its implementation. This was a welcome relief for car owners, who no longer had to worry as much about their vehicles being stolen. Overall, the immobilizer system proved to be an effective solution to the vehicle theft rates in San Francisco.

As the years went by, San Francisco continued to see a decrease in vehicle thefts. However, car owners who wanted to take extra precautions, would have to look up for more effective ways to minimize the risk of theft.

A tool that could have prevented further the thefts, would be an interactive plot showing the safest districts to park your car on each day based on thefts recorded so far in each area. A plot like this would have been of extreme help, especially for the many citizens who would frequently visited the city, when parking was difficult to find. The plot is based on police data and shows the districts of the city with the lowest number of reported vehicle thefts on each day. Through further examination, it is proven that "safe" areas are typically neighborhoods with high pedestrian traffic and visible security cameras, as well as areas with strong police presence or "important" building such as ministries, embassies, town halls etc.

With this tool, people that would have this information in their hands, would have been able to make wiser decisions on where to park their car without the constant fear of it being stolen or broked-in. San Francisco may still have its share of vehicle thefts, but with the right information, cizitens and tourists could have protected themselves and enjoy all that the city has to offer.

By delving deeper into the data, it is realized that vehicle theft is not evenly distributed across the city.

To better understand the patterns, the following interactive visualization allows you to explore the data in more detail.

As we explored the plot, we noticed some interesting patterns. Some districts had a much higher relative frequency of vehicle theft than others, with one district in particular standing out as having a significantly higher rate than the others.

We decided to investigate further, looking at factors that might be contributing to the high rate of theft in this particular district. We found that the district had a high population density and a high percentage of rental properties, both of which are known risk factors for vehicle theft. Finally, a further investigation and research into vehicle breaks-in and thefts over the San Franscisco area, spotlights the fact that despite some districts appear to have a relatively low car-theft rate, there are several hot-spots spread around the city that still constitute alarming areas of theft.[Breaking down San Francisco’s car break-in epidemic](https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2018/sf-car-breakins/?fbclid=IwAR2XwFmPR6H0lH-Dv7GImHBQ3hFwoFpZyiJroNSY2M86mBZ8-jFTqJhqOMk.pdf).

Unraveling San Franscisco's chronicle on vehicle-thefts, there are few examples of hot-spots that stand out. Richmond district appears to have a decreased relative frequency of car thefts. However, Point Lobos Avenue constitutes a major spot with an increased rate of thefts throughout the years. The area around the avenue, has large parking lots being out of sight of people's eyes. A supplementing factor on the increased theft on Bayview district, is beyond any doubt Illinois and Third Street in Dogpatch. As reported by both citizens and victims of car theft, the area has become a popular nightlife destination where industrial backstreet runs and warehouses are located that provide free or relatively cheap parking space. The streets are becoming dark and quiet at nights and thus, vehicles can become an easy prey for the lawbreakers.An insightful depiction of [San Francisco’s auto break-in hot spots](https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/san-francisco-auto-burglary-hot-spots-12756952.php?fbclid=IwAR3IF4jjp2ajAXWO80SvHfuTFviEiyF6tVOzJRDreWfT8xDKo4lIctct0v0.pdf) is narrated in this.
